  <h1>Sonnet</h1>
    <h3>Upon the moss where silent shadows creep,
A noble steed doth wander, proud yet free;
Through ancient oaks, where winding roots still sleep,
It treads the path where none but dreams may be.

The moon, a lantern hung in heaven’s dome,
Doth gild his mane with threads of silver light;
The forest hums, as if to bid him home,
Yet on he roams, a phantom in the night.</h3>

Yet on he roams, a phantom in the night.

O gallant soul, dost seek a master’s call,
Or chase the winds where mortal feet are stayed?
The earth beneath, the stars above thee all,
Bear witness to the course thy heart hath laid.

Thus rides he on, where mortal song is mute,
A timeless king, in nature’s vast pursuit.</h1>
